## Contract Factory - April 2017

This is the finished app that goes with the video series. 

This example uses down-rev versions of the tools (we are working on that). In order to get it working without interfering with your other projects and latest tools, we suggest you perform this exercise on a dedicated virtual machine or vagrant box.

### Works with

- ubuntu 16.04
- angular v1.5.6
- nodejs v6.10.0
- truffle v3.1.9
- solc 0.4.6
- testrpc v3.0.3
- truffle-default-builder 2.0.0

### To get it working

This repo is not compatible with truffle 4.x or ganache-cli. 
To get it working, install older versions of both as follows:

Start with Ubuntu 16.04

You need node & npm. 

```
$ npm --version
$ nvm --version
```

If it's not there, install the Node Version Manager

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.25.0/install.sh | bash
```
You have to close your terminal and start a new one. 

Install node v6, npm and git
```
$ nvm install 6
$ node --version
$ sudo apt-get install npm git
```

Install truffle and testrpc

```
$ npm install -g truffle@3.1.9
$ npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc
```

Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rob-Hitchens/contractFactory2017.git
```

Move to the project folder
```
cd contractFactory2017
```

```
$ npm install
```

NOTE: Some students have reported strange errors when the windows are open randomly instead of as described here. 

Open a new window and run a blockchain on port 8545

```
$ nvm use 6
$ testrpc
```

Back to the first window. Run

```
$ truffle compile --all
$ truffle migrate --reset
```

Build the UI app from sources

```
$ truffle build
```

Serve the UI app

```
$ cd build
$ truffle serve
```

Open a web browser to http://localhost:8080
